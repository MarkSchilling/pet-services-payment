# Pet Services Payment
## “Go/No Go” decisions

Here are some potential "Go/No Go" decisions based on milestones for customer discovery and validation for a pet services payment system/app:

1. Milestone: Problem Validation
- Go decision: There is a clear problem that pet owners face with the current payment options for pet services.
- No Go decision: There is not a clear problem or it is not significant enough to warrant a new payment system.
2. Milestone: Solution Validation
- Go decision: There is interest in a new payment system for pet services from pet owners and service providers.
- No Go decision: There is not enough interest in a new payment system or the proposed solution does not adequately address the identified problem.
3. Milestone: MVP Testing
- Go decision: The MVP (minimum viable product) is well-received by early adopters and initial feedback is positive.
- No Go decision: The MVP does not meet the needs of early adopters or there are major issues with the product that cannot be easily fixed.
4. Milestone: Scaling Strategy
- Go decision: There is a clear path to scaling the product and acquiring a significant user base.
- No Go decision: There are significant barriers to scaling or the market is too small to justify the investment needed to scale.
5. Milestone: Business Model Validation
- Go decision: The business model is viable and there is a clear path to profitability.
- No Go decision: The business model is not viable or there are major obstacles to achieving profitability.

It's important to note that these milestones and decisions will vary based on the specific product and market. It's also important to continually reassess and adjust these decisions as new information becomes available.
