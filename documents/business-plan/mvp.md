# Pet Services Payment System

## Minimal Viable Product

A minimal viable product (MVP) for a pet services payment system could include the following features:

- User registration and login: Pet owners and service providers should be able to create an account on the platform and log in to access their account information.
- Payment processing: The payment system should support payment processing between pet owners and service providers. This could include the ability to make payments using credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.
- Service provider profiles: Service providers should be able to create a profile that includes information such as their business name, location, and services offered.
- Search functionality: Pet owners should be able to search for service providers based on location, services offered, and other criteria.
- Appointment scheduling: Service providers should be able to set their availability and allow pet owners to book appointments through the platform.
- Payment history: Both pet owners and service providers should be able to view their payment history on the platform.
- Notifications: The platform should send notifications to both pet owners and service providers to confirm appointments, payment processing, and other important updates.
- Feedback system: Pet owners should be able to leave feedback on their experience with a particular service provider, which can help other pet owners make more informed decisions.

The MVP should be designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and intuitive user interface. The main goal of the MVP is to test the core functionalities of the platform and gather feedback from users. As the platform evolves, additional features can be added based on user feedback and market demands.
